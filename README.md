# Movie Search
Movie Search for Thinkful API Capstone Project - a place to search for movie types and get a list of recommended movies based on the user search. This app is useful for movie watchers who are trying to figure out what their next movie will be. After watching a movie, users can find themselves in a situation thinking "Which movie do I watch next?". This app is designed to help users answer that question. Movie search will allow users to search for a type of movie and it will return movie titles, descriptions, and a link with a clip from the movie results for the user.

Other notes from your reviewer: Nice job on this project, it is well executed. The code base is good and is efficient. The site responds well for the most part across different devices. You need to set line-height on the first h1 as when it breaks to two lines, the line-height is much too high. Does the API allow you to set your own placeholder image if an image is not present? The current placeholder image in the case of no image on the results looks low quality on a retina screen or a modern tablet. I would also slightly decrease the line height for the paragraph content for each result. I'm not sure if you need to include so much text that the user has to scroll considerably, although if this is the case that is the only design related solution I can think of. The design works for the app's purpose. It's great you included a landing page but I think you need to make the app even clearer. At first I was surprised when I typed in the "The Shining" that movie wasn't shown. It showed similar Kubrick movies. You need to make it abundantly clear this is a suggestion or related titles app in the opening. At first after reading and using the app I thought it was just a movie search. I then did not understand whether I should type in a genre of films or a film name itself. The project is close to being a portfolio piece it just needs a little refinement and a more concise landing page message so a hiring manager knows the purpose of the app right away. Keep working hard and cheers!


-Change title to Movie Recommendation Search? type your favorite movie to get suggestions for your next movie
-Make it 2 columns instead of 3? make paragraph height taller
